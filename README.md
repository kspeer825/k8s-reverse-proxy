# Kubernetes Reverse Proxy
[Kong](https://konghq.com/) offers an open source reverse proxy service built on top of nginx that can run on [Kubernetes](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.8.x/install/kubernetes/proxy/).

This repo demos how to spin up an instance of the reverse proxy locally.

## Demo

### Dependencies
* [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) local K8s orchestration
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/) K8s CLI
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) K8s package manager
* [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) (optional) K8s terminal-based UI

### Setup
Start up the reverse proxy services:
```
$ make bootstrap

‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Bootstrap complete.
```

Enable port forwarding in a separate shell:
```
$ make port-forward  # exposes 8001,8005
```
Configure an endpoint:
```
$ curl -s "localhost:8001/services" -d name=mock -d url="https://httpbin.konghq.com" | jq .
$ curl -s "localhost:8001/services/mock/routes" -d "paths=/mock" | jq .
```
Validate that requests can be proxied:
```
$ make test

‚úÖ Kong CP is Active.
‚úÖ Kong DP is Active.
```
There should be three healthy services running; the control plane, the data plane, and the database.

### Teardown
```
$ make nuke

üß® NUKING Kong...
release "kong-cp" uninstalled

```

Note: This local implementation relies on running a [k3s](https://k3s.io/) node using colima. This can be ran independently from the reverse proxy services for other use cases.
```
colima start --kubernetes
```

## Use Cases

### Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy enables a single ingress point to upstream web services. The Kong Gateway accomplishes this through path-based routing. This is useful for scenarios where you have upstream web apps or APIs that are non-public facing, but still require secure ingress from the internet. You can configure paths to your private web services in Kong, expose the K8s ingress entry-point, and apply one of the supported authentication methods at the proxy level (see [Kong Auth plugins](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/?tier=free&category=authentication)).

#### Configure
Endpoint A:
```
curl "localhost:8001/services" -d name=serviceA -d url="https://speerportfolio.com"

curl "localhost:8001/services/serviceA/routes" -d paths="/"
```

Endpoint B:
```
curl "localhost:8001/services" -d name=serviceB -d url="https://github.com/kspeer825"

curl "localhost:8001/services/serviceB/routes" -d paths="/gh" -d preserve_host=true
```

#### Validate

You can now proxy requests from the local K8s cluster to different domains using the `/` and `/gh` paths: [localhost/](https://localhost/) and [localhost/gh](https://localhost/gh).

### Response Caching

Responses for frequently made requests can be cached at your ingress point in order to reduce response times, and lighten the load on upstream services. The open source [Proxy Cache](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/proxy-cache/) plugin can be configured based on request method, content type, and status code. It can be applied to a specific endpoint or requester.

#### Configure:
```
curl "localhost:8001/plugins" -d "name=proxy-cache" -d "config.request_method=GET" -d "config.response_code=200" -d "config.content_type=application/json" -d "config.cache_ttl=30" -d "config.strategy=memory"
```

#### Validate:
```
curl -s -i -X GET http://localhost:80/mock/anything | grep X-Cache
```

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting can be enabled in order to protect against DOS attacks, or to limit usage on upstream services. The open source [Rate Limiting](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/) plugin can be configured based on requests per unit time (second, minute, hour, etc.). It can be applied to a specific endpoint or requester, and can aggregate requests by various fields.

#### Configure:
```
curl localhost:8001/plugins -d "name=rate-limiting" -d "config.minute=5" -d "config.policy=local"

```

#### Validate:
```
for _ in {1..6}; do curl -i -s localhost:80/mock/anything; sleep 1; done
```
